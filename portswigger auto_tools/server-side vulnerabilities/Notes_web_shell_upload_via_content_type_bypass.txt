APPRENTICE

Base url: https://0aa800b204a5eac5841065cd001a003c.web-security-academy.net/
Login url: https://0aa800b204a5eac5841065cd001a003c.web-security-academy.net/login

The avatar uploaded is stored in /file/avatars/ instead of /resources/images/ as such as other images
The login form data: {csrf: <token>, username: <user>, password: <pass>}
The file-upload form data: {avatar: (file_name, file_data, content_type)} and payload data: {csrf:<token>, user: username}

Account url: https://0aa800b204a5eac5841065cd001a003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account

The file uploaded will be called by GET https://0aa800b204a5eac5841065cd001a003c.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/<file name>

First try: upload file php directively 
(Sorry, file type text/x-python is not allowed Only image/jpeg and image/png are allowed 
Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.) -> The webserver check <content_type>
